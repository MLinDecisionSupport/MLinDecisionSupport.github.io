  Machine Learning in Prognostic Decision-Support Systems Study
 </h1>
</head>
  <h3>Details</h3>
  <p>
    Thank you for your interest in our study.</br>
    The purpose of the study is to investigate the factors that generate value for the use of Machine Learning models in generating prognostic predictions as part of decision-support systems designed to augment and complement the work of medical professionals and diagnosticians.<br/>
    In particular, we are looking to make Machine Learning algorithms more <i>transparent, explainable</i>, and <i>interpretable</i> by discovering how different model information and Decision-Support system design choices affect the confidence of medical experts in such systems.<br/>
    The study proceeds in two stages:
    <ol>
        <li><b>About the model</b>, which introduces and presents information regarding the <b>Neural Network</b> powering our Decision-Support System</li>
        <li><b>Decision Support</b>, which introduces a mock decision-support system designed to present predicted risk scores for patients</li>
    </ol> 
    
    In this study, we focus on patients who have experienced heart failure, and predict the probability, or risk, of death one year after their heart failure event.<br/><br/>

    <h5>General Information</h5>
        <p>Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence models are gaining enthusiasm for their ability to produce highly accurate predictive and analytical insights. However, as many such models, including neural networks, are <i>black-boxes</i>, many fields of practice are reluctant to utilize these models without an ability to interpret their results or understand how a model generates its prediction.</p>
        <p>As a result, although ML models appear like natural and powerful choices for powering systems that support and augment decision-making processes for medical clinicians, there has so far not been a heavy push to incorporate these into practice in the medical field.</p>
        <p>The aim of this study is to explore this phenomenon and understand what type of model evidence and interpretability modules will increase comprehension and the confidence levels for users in different machine learning predictive models utilized in decision-support systems for prognostics.</p>

    <div class = 'Evidence1'>
        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>The model was trained using the Meta-analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure (MAGGIC) data-set, which compiled patient data from 30 studies including both randomized clinical trials and observational registries.</p>
        <p>The data set included <b>30,389</b> patients who have experienced a <b>heart failure</b> event. Of these, 18.8% died within 1 year of experiencing heart failure.</p>
        <p>31 patient characteristics were collected, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Basic patient details</b>: Age, gender, ethnicity</li>
            <li><b>Patient habits</b>: BMI, Smoking, Diabetes condition</li>
            <li><b>Physical symptoms</b>: Shortness of breath (at rest and exercise), rales</li>

            <h3>Model Training and Implementation</h3>
            <p>The model utilized was a Neural Network, a sophisticated deep learning algorithm that has seen increased attention in recent years, as multiple studies have shown it to vastly outperform simpler linear models and other methods that have been traditionally utilized to generate risk scores in medicine.</p>
            <p>A neural network is a Machine Learning algorithm inspired by the human brain, utilizing connected nodes organized in hidden layers. The network uses optimization techniques and non-linear activation functions to automatically discover complex patterns and learn how to make predictions from data. You can find more information <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <p>Below is a generic image of a neural network by Machine Learning expert <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html" target="_blank">Michael Nielsen</a>:</p>
            <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="NN.png" style="width:500px;"></p>
            <p>The network takes in a large amount of data, in the form of patient characteristics, and outputs the probability of a patient dying within 1 year of a heart failure event.</p>
            <p>The Neural Network we utilized contained 2 hidden layers of 100 and 20 nodes respectively. Such a network architecture is sufficiently large to capture sophisticated non-linear data patterns, but not too large, thus avoiding overfitting.</p>
            <p>The model was trained using 10-fold cross validation, using 90% of the data for training and the rest for testing. This was repeated 10 times, and we report average figures over the run.</p>

                <h3>Model Accuracy</h3>
                <p>The neural network showcases <b>81.26%</b> accuracy, which means that 81% of the test cases were classified correctly by the model.</p>
                <p>The model's AUC-ROC (receiver operating curve), which is equal to the C-Index, is <b>0.725</b>, with a standard deviation of 0.0054, averaged over 10 runs.<br/>This value is much higher than the best linear regression model, which achieves AUC-ROC of 0.537. It is also significantly higher than the AUC-ROC of the MAGGIC Risk Score, which is 0.6933.

For information on the MAGGIC Risk Score, <a href="http://www.heartfailurerisk.org/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
                <p>The model's ROC curve is below:</p>
                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="NNROC.png" style="width:250px;"></p>
                <p>In addition, the model achieves an AUC-PR (precision recall curve) of <b>0.376</b>, higher than a Linear Regression model (0.250) and the MAGGIC Risk Score (0.342).

                <h3>Model Interpretation: Stratified Linear Approximation</h3>
                <p>Black-box models, like neural networks, can be <b>approximated locally</b> using simpler models, including linear regression models.</p>
                <p>To create local approximations, a different linear model was trained for each quintile of risk: 0-20%, 20-40%, etc.</p>
                <p>The Root Mean-Sqaured Error between the neural network model and the linear approximation is 0.036, suggesting the 2 models are very close.</p>
                <p>Below is a summary of the coefficients for each local linear model:</p>
                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="NNSLIM.png" style="width:600px;"></p>
                <p>The value of each characteristic’s coefficient represents their contribution to the variability in predicted patient risk score.</p>
                <p>For instance, the negative coefficient for Beta blocker prescriptions suggests this treatment is appropriate, as it lowers risk of death. Some factors, such as shortness of breath at rest or gender, are only significant for high risk groups.</p>

                <p>Black-box models, like neural networks, can be <b>approximated</b> using simpler models, such as decision trees.</p>
                <p>To create local approximations, a different decision tree was trained for each quintile of risk: 0-20%, 20-40%, etc.</p>
                <p>The Root Mean-Sqaured Error between the neural network model and the decision tree approximation is 0.046, suggesting the 2 models are very close.</p>

    <p>
        Thank you very much for taking our survey. Your anonymous results will be used as part of a statistical and ML analysis to determine the best evidence to present to potential users of decision-support systems that rely on sophisticated ML models.<br/>
        We trust that your efforts will be highly significant in helping design Decision-Support systems for prognostic predictions based on Machine Learning models that are useful and make valuable contributions to prognostics and medicine in general.
        Thank you!
    </p>
