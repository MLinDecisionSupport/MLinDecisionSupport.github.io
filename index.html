  Machine Learning in Prognostic Decision-Support Systems Study
 </h1>
</head>
  <h3>Details</h3>
  <p>
    Thank you for your interest in our study.</br>
    The purpose of the study is to investigate the potential value of Machine Learning models in generating prognostic predictions as part of decision-support systems designed to augment and complement the work of medical professionals and diagnosticians.<br/>
    The study proceeds by presenting 3 patient scenarios, focusing on patients who have experienced heart failure. Each scenario is followed by a predicted risk score generated from one of three models:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Linear Regression</b>, a highly familiar and well-known model that has conventionally been used to generate risk scores, as it is easily interpretable by users</li>
        <li><b>Random Forest</b>, a Machine Learning model that has been demonstrated in literature in many cases to be state-of-the-art, achieving accurate results</li>
        <li><b>Neural Network</b>, a highly-regarded Machine Learning method that has garnered increased attention by the research community in recent years</li>
    </ul> 
    
    The study presents various forms of evidence, interpretations, and representations of these models to learn how best to increase medical experts' confidence in Machine Learning models.<br/><br/>

    <h5>General Information</h5>
        <p>Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence models are gaining enthusiasm for their ability to produce highly accurate predictive and analytical insights. However, as many such models, including neural networks, are <i>black-boxes</i>, many fields of practice are reluctant to utilize these models without an ability to interpret their results or understand how a model generates its prediction.</p>
        <p>The aim of this study is to explore this phenomenon and understand what type of model evidence and interpretability modules will increase comprehension and the confidence levels for users in different machine learning predictive models utilized in decision-support systems for prognostics.</p>
        <p>We appreciate your interest in participating in this online survey. You have been invited to participate as an expert in medicine, computer science, or related. Please read through these terms before beginning the survey. You will participate by ticking the <i>Start</i> box below. You may ask any questions before taking part by contacting the researcher (details below).</p>
        <p>We, the University of Oxford, are investigating Machine Learning model interpretability. You will be presented with limited information on a machine learning model, followed by further evidence regrading the model. You will then be asked to rate your confidence level with utilizing the model for predictive purposes and support your answers.</p>
        <p>The full survey should take about 15-20 minutes. No background knowledge is required. Your results will be utilized to determine the best interpretability modules and types of evidence to present to potential users of different machine learning models, and will be collected and utilized by the Computer Science and Engineering Departments at Oxford. <b>No personally identifiable information will be collected or shared</b>.</p>
    <h5>Do I have to take part?</h5>
        <p>Please note that your participation is voluntary. You may withdraw at any point during the questionnaire for any reason, before submitting your answers, by closing the browser. None of your answers will then be collected.</p>
    <h5>How will your data be used?</h5>
        <p>Your answers will be completely anonymous, and we will use all reasonable endeavours to keep them confidential. No personally identifiable, including but not limited to IP address, email address, or name, will be requested or collected.</p>
        <p>Your answers will be stored in a password-protected file and may be used in academic publications. Your IP address will not be stored. Research data will be stored for a minimum of three years after publication or public release.</p>
    <h5>Who will have access to your data?</h5>
        <p>The University of Oxford is the data controller for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
        <p>We would like your permission to use your unidentifiable data in future studies, and to share data with other researchers (e.g. in online databases).</p>
        <p>Any personal information that could identify you will not be collected or be removed before files are shared with other researchers or results are made public.</p>
        <p>This survey is for an MSc project. The principal researcher is Owen Lahav, who is attached to the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford. This project is being completed under the supervision of Mihaela van der Schaar.
